Project Name: Room Monitor

Student Name: *John Joey Wright*   Student ID: *20105823*

  My IoT idea is a room monitor which will allow the user to monitor a room in your house. it will be able to measure the temperature of the room, when the lights turn on/off and a camera facing outside the window to see what nature has to offer. The camera feed will be displayed on a website and the monitors (light, temp) will be emailed to you at 10:00pm every night giving you the average temperature throughout the day and how many times the lights were turned on. The monitors will be connected to a LCD Screen which will display the time and the current room temperature.
